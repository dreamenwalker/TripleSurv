# Environment
Our code is based on pytorch tool. The main packages can be found in the file requirements.txt.

- Python 3.11.9
- PyTorch 2.2.1

- NVIDIA GPU + [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

# Clone the github repo and go to the default directory

conda create -n tkde python=3.11.9
conda activate tkde
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Training

The main train file is train.py.
python train.py
